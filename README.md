Ti ACE is a comprehensive career guidance solution that helps Citizens explore the right career options and achieve their desired goals.

## Product document	

### Problem statement 

In many cases, individuals are unaware of the career options available to them and may end up pursuing a career based on their surroundings, especially in the context of the Indian middle class. This can lead to individuals realizing that they are not well-suited for their current career at a later point in time, but they are unable to change direction due to the time, money, and effort already invested. As a result, they are forced to continue on their current path even if they are dissatisfied and unable to excel. 

This not only affects the person's overall lifestyle but also represents a loss to society and the country as the individual may have otherwise contributed more effectively to a more suitable career.
 
### Solution description 

Ti ACE is a career guidance solution designed to help individuals navigate career options based on their verified skills, interests, and other relevant factors. Ti ACE comprises five modules - Aware, Aspire, Assess, Able, and Access - which work together to provide comprehensive career guidance. 

 **Aware**: This module helps individuals get awareness about varied career choices.

 **Aspire**: This module recommends and helps individuals select a matching career option.
 
 **Assess**: This module assesses all the skill sets required for the selected career option.
 
 **Able**: This module helps individuals navigate through the right courses and mentors.
 
 **Access**: This module helps individuals access a fulfilling career.


As individuals progress in their chosen career paths, the roadmap could become clearer and more detailed. The options presented could narrow down as individuals narrow down their skill sets and preferences. This approach helps individuals make informed decisions about their career paths, leading to more fulfilling lives and increased contributions to society.

Overall, Ti ACE provides valuable support to individuals struggling to navigate the complex landscape of career options and requirements. It helps them make informed decisions and choose career paths that align with their passions and strengths.

And recommends the career path/learning path to the user.

 - Users choose the recommended career path. Now the User starts his learning journey, here the Able module uses Sunbird Knowlg and Sunbird Ed which provides the courses and their skill content. 

 - Post completion of the skills the Assess module is used to assess the skill through which quiz, question sets, etc  using Sunbird Inquiry,  and a certificate  is provided by leveraging Sunbird RC.

 - Once the user passes the skill assessments, verifiable skill credentials are provided. In the Access module Beckn protocol is used to discover jobs and internship opportunities across the open network by showcasing the skill certificates.
